This program will take inputs for two numbers, and then print them back out. It will also tell the user if the numbers they typed are less than, greater
than, or equal to each other. The user will also have an option to play again


Review by Daniel Decoito: The program works well, I tried to break it but I couldnt find a way to do it. The only issue is the code itself. it gets the job done but its pretty long and messy. consider using terenary operators or switch statments to clean things up a bit. Otherwise everything worked great.
